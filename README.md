DESCRIPTION :

A chatting app using Socket.IO is a real-time communication application that allows users to exchange messages instantly. Built using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app leverages Socket.IO, a powerful library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. The app is developed using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the primary code editor, and the Live Server extension is used to run and test the app in real-time. This project is an excellent way to understand real-time web applications and how WebSockets work under the hood.
